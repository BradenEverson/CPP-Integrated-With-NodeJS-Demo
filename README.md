# CPP Integration Test
##A test to teach myself how to use GYP as a means of compiling c++ code as a Node accessable module!
##Integrates the find and replace method I created initially as an extension of the std namespace into a quickly thrown together html frontend to teach both initializing a module build and further rebuilding and configuring said module :)
